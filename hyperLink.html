      <p class="webpage_subtitle_description">
        WLoC stands for "With the Line of Codes", a platform where you can find various posts about different topics including music, art, and more. 
        Bascically, it is a collection of posts that I have written over time. 
        After all, I am a human being and I have my own interests and hobbies. 
        So, I thought why not share them with the world? 
        However, I am not a professional writer, that is why I decided to share my thoughts and ideas in a more unique way. 
        That is with the codes, which I learn from certain programming languages and concepts.
        And then, I create contents, designs, webpages. 
        All with the lessons I have learn so far and I will try my best to make them interesting and informative. 
        In a meaningful way, I am sharing my journey of learning and exploring the world of programming and web development. 
        So, are you ready to join me on this journey? 
        Let's explore the world of WLoC together!

            <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Lauren-aquilina" style="color: lightcoral;">

            The song is about resilience and the ability to rise again after facing challenges. 
            Plus, it encourages listeners to embrace their strength and potential.
            The lyrics are powerful and the melody is uplifting, making it a perfect anthem for anyone who has ever felt down or defeated.
            The song's message is clear: no matter how many times you fall, you can always get back up and reclaim your power.
            The song is a reminder that we all have the strength to overcome obstacles and emerge stronger than before.
            It is a call to action for anyone who has ever felt lost or defeated, encouraging them to rise up and take control of their life again.
            For this reasons, I have decided to share this song with you all.

            [Verse 1]
            You're alone, you're on your own, so what?
            Have you gone blind?
            Have you forgotten what you have and what is yours?
            Glass half empty, glass half full
            Well, either way, you won't be going thirsty
            Count your blessings, not your flaws

            [Chorus]
            You've got it all
            You lost your mind in the sound
            There's so much more
            You can reclaim your crown
            You're in control
            Rid of the monsters inside your head
            Put all your faults to bed
            You can be king again

            [Verse 2]
            You don't get what all this is about
            You're too wrapped up in your self-doubt
            You've got that young blood, set it free

            [Chorus]
            You've got it all
            You lost your mind in the sound
            There's so much more
            You can reclaim your crown
            You're in control
            Rid of the monsters inside your head
            Put all your faults to bed
            You can be king
            
            [Bridge]
            There's method in my madness
            There's no logic in your sadness
            You don't gain a single thing from misery
            Take it from me

            [Chorus]
            You've got it all
            You lost your mind in the sound
            There's so much more
            You can reclaim your crown
            You're in control
            Rid of the monsters inside your head
            Put all your faults to bed
            You can be king
            You've got it all
            You lost your mind in the sound
            There's so much more
            You can reclaim your crown
            You're in control
            Rid of the monsters inside your head
            Put all your faults to bed
            You can be king again
